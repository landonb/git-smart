# Prints *largest* version tag.
# - We assume the largest tag is the latest tag.
# - Perhaps this command should be renamed, e.g.,
#     git-largest-version
#  but people tend to think of "latest" version
#  as the largest version, and it might be
#  confusing to return a smaller version than
#  the largest if the user happened to apply
#  version tags "out of order". So we'll assume
#  the user really wants the largest version tag
#  that's even been used.
