# Creates a fixup commit and then rebases it where it needs to be.
#
# Assuming you've added the files you want fixed-up, e.g.,
#
#   git add {some-changes}
#
# Then running `git fup {commit}` is similar to the following steps:
#
#   git commit --no-verify --fixup={commit}
#   git add -A && git ci -m WIP
#   git rebase -i --autosquash {commit}^
#   # Save the file
#   git pop1  # Undo the WIP.

# USAGE: git fup {commit}
